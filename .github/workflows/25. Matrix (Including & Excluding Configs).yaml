# matrix:                   Use matrix to define a matrix of different job configurations. Within your matrix, define one or more variables followed by an array of values.
# continue-on-error: true   Prevents a workflow run from failing when a job fails. Set to true to allow a workflow run to pass when this job fails.
# fail-fast: false          Setting fail-fast to false prevents GitHub from canceling all in-progress jobs if any matrix job fails. Default: true
# max-parallel: 3           Only 3 Jobs Runs at a time. The maximum number of jobs that can run simultaneously when using a matrix job strategy. By default, GitHub will maximize the number of jobs run in parallel depending on runner availability.
